     I use PayPal for all transactions. The client is expected to cover the transaction fee which will be added on the final charge.<br><br>

    If you post a video that I edited for you. I request that you credit me.<br><br>

    Do not ask me to use generative AI in your video. I firmly stand against generative AI. As well do not use any videos I make for you in AI training. Breaking of this rule will result in a fine of 100,000$<br><br>

    When I make a video, you hold the right to use the video for any purpose personal or commercially. As well as I hold the right to put the video in my portfolio if I so choose.<br><br>

    When it comes to revisions, I will provide two free revisions. After that 20% will be added to your total per revison. However mistakes on my end will be fixed for free.<br><br>
    
    I reserve the right to reject any commission at any point for any reason. You will be notified if that does happen.<br><br> 

    I will not take abuse; you will either treat me with respect or we will not do business together. Violent language or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.<br><br>

    If I tell you that I am donating my time to a project, you will not owe me any sort of compensation now or later.<br><br>

    I like to stay in touch with my clients, so I hold weekly meetings with each of them to ensure the direction of the video editing is the way you want it to go. We can talk about the work you want to do, things you want to try, and go over any new ideas or strategies I may have discovered. The frequency of meetings can match the frequency of editing requested, but I would like at least one call per month.<br><br>

    For the purposes of payment with Long Form Videos, the length of the first completed version (not the storyboard) I send you for review will be used in determining the cost of the video.<br><br>

    Prices will be re-evaluated once a year during October. If prices change while we are working together, you will be notified.<br><br>

    If you need to cancel before I send you the storyboard, you will not be charged anything. After I send you the storyboard, you will be charged 50%, and after I send you the first version, you will be charged the full amount.<br><br>

    If for whatever reason I have to cancel a project at any point before sending you the first version, you will not be charged anything, as long as it was not because of a violation of the TOS.<br><br>

    The editing process comes in three stages. Stage one is us discussing what you want from the video. Stage two, I will send you a storyboard, which is just the video cut up so that you can approve or tell me changes you want to the flow of the video. Stage three is me finally sending you the full video with all the editing bells and whistles we have agreed upon.<br><br>

    Once everything has been approved and finalized, I will send you the final video through Google Drive.
